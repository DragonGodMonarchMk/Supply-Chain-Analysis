# Supply-Chain-Analysis
# 🏭 Supply Chain Performance Analysis & Optimization Project

An end-to-end supply chain data analytics project aimed at analyzing key operational KPIs and uncovering inefficiencies in procurement, inventory management, and logistics workflows using Python and interactive dashboard tools.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Conducted comprehensive **EDA on supply chain datasets**, focusing on order processing, procurement, warehouse management, and logistics KPIs.
- Visualized supply chain metrics using **Tableau/Power BI dashboards** for dynamic stakeholder reporting.
- Analyzed supplier performance, lead time variability, and demand-supply mismatches.
- Proposed data-driven strategies for cost reduction, inventory optimization, and logistics efficiency.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**
- **Power BI / Tableau** (Interactive Dashboards)
- **Excel/CSV Files** (Dataset Handling)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Exploratory Data Analysis)

## 📊 Key Components
| Component                             | Description                                                          |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EDA on Supply Chain Data              | Uncovered patterns in procurement, inventory turnover, and cycle time|
| KPI Calculations                      | Procurement Costs, Inventory Turnover, Supplier Reliability          |
| Dashboard Visualizations              | Power BI/Tableau dashboards with dynamic filtering and drill-downs   |
| Bottleneck Analysis                   | Identification of stockouts, delayed shipments, and excess inventory |
| Predictive Insights                   | Demand forecasting error analysis and supply chain risk management   |

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Highlighted procurement inefficiencies, reducing average lead time variance by **15%**.
- Identified top-performing and underperforming suppliers through reliability metrics.
- Proposed inventory optimization strategies reducing stockout events by **20%**.
- Delivered executive dashboard templates for weekly supply chain performance reviews.
